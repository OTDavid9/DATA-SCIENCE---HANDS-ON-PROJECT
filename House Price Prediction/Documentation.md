# Hands-On Project: Using Regression to Demonstrate a Machine Learning Model | HOUSE PRICE PREDICTION

## Objective
The goal of this project is to predict house prices based on various features using regression models. It provides hands-on experience with the complete machine learning pipeline, from data preparation to model evaluation.

## Dataset Overview
The dataset includes features commonly associated with housing prices and is well-suited for regression tasks. The dependent variable (`House_Price`) is a continuous value representing the price of a house. The assumption is that the dataset is clean

## Features
### Independent Variables
1. **Square_Footage**  
   - **Description**: Size of the house in square feet.  
   - **Impact**: Larger homes tend to have higher prices.

2. **Num_Bedrooms**  
   - **Description**: Number of bedrooms in the house.  
   - **Impact**: Additional bedrooms generally increase the home's value.

3. **Num_Bathrooms**  
   - **Description**: Number of bathrooms in the house.  
   - **Impact**: More bathrooms are associated with higher property prices.

4. **Year_Built**  
   - **Description**: Year the house was constructed.  
   - **Impact**: Older houses may depreciate in value, depending on their condition.

5. **Lot_Size**  
   - **Description**: Lot size in acres.  
   - **Impact**: Larger lots typically add more value to a property.

6. **Garage_Size**  
   - **Description**: Number of cars the garage can accommodate.  
   - **Impact**: Larger garages generally correspond to higher home prices.

7. **Neighborhood_Quality**  
   - **Description**: Neighborhood quality rating (scale of 1-10).  
   - **Impact**: Houses in better neighborhoods often command premium prices.

### Target Variable
8. **House_Price**  
   - **Description**: The dependent variable representing the price of the house.  
   - **Objective**: Predict this value using the other features.

## Project Steps

### 1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Analyze the distribution of the target variable and features.
- Check for missing values and outliers.
- Visualize relationships between features and the target variable.

### 2. Data Preprocessing
- Handle missing values using imputation techniques.
- Scale numerical features and encode categorical ones (if applicable).
- Split the dataset into training and testing sets.

### 3. Feature Selection
- Evaluate feature importance using:
  - Correlation matrices.
  - Feature selection techniques (e.g., Recursive Feature Elimination).

### 4. Model Selection
Train multiple regression models, such as:
- **Linear Regression**
- **Decision Tree Regressor**
- **Random Forest Regressor**
- **Gradient Boosting Regressor**

### 5. Model Evaluation
Evaluate model performance using metrics like:
- **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**
- **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**
- **R-squared (RÂ²)**

### 6. Hyperparameter Tuning
- Optimize model parameters using Grid Search or Random Search.

### 7. Insights and Visualization
- Plot feature importance to identify the most influential factors.
- Compare model predictions with actual values using visualizations.

### 8. Deployment (Optional)
- Deploy the final model using a web framework or API for real-time predictions.
